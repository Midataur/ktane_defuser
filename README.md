# ktane_defuser

## A program to assist with defusing bombs in Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes

###Supports all modules up to Simon, more coming soon.

Usage: Run defuser.py (Currently python2 but converting it wouldn't be difficult). Answer the initial bomb variable questions.

To get help about specific commands type "help" in the prompt. I'll add that info here at some point when I get around to it.
